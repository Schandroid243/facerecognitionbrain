# Facial Image Recognition App (FRONT END CODE)
This project is from a Udemy course called The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery, which teaches you how to become a full stack web developer.

Project Guidelines
The aim for this project is to build a facial image recognition web app using the latest technology trends. To complete the project, the below user stories needed to be fulfilled:

I can can upload an image, click on a button and have the faces (if any are found) detected with a square box
I am able to register
I am able to login and logout
There is an image upload counter that tells each user the total number of image uploads that they have done
The page UI is different when the user is logged in
Project Approach
For this full-stack web application, I created the front end components and UI using React, JavaScript, CSS & HTML. This involved creating the signin, register and the home (logged in) screens.

The next part was creating the backend of this project using node.js and ensuring that the GET, POST and PUT requests would properly function handling the API calls, as well as handling the data. Later on, the data would be connected to a database.

The last part of the web app was to build a relational database using PostgreSQL to retrieve, store and update each user's data. All these aspects were connected together and tested to ensure each part works.

The app was fully deployed to Heroku.

Made with
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js & PostgreSQL
Complied Using
Babel

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
